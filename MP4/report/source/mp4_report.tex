{\large \underline{Introduction}:}

\ \\
The /proc directory is a pseudo filesystem that allows access to kernel data structures while in user space. It allows you to view some of the information the kernel keeps on running processes. To view information about a specific process you just need to view files inside of the directory: /proc/[pid]. For more information simply view the manpage with man proc.  

\ \\
{\large \textbf{The Assignment}:} \newline
\ \\
Using the files stored at /proc write a program/script to find information about a specific process using a user provided pid. In the following, you will find a list of the task\_struct members for which you are required to find their value. In the task\_struct a lot of the data you are finding is not represented as member values but instead pointers to other linux data structures that contain these members. All of the information you will be retrieving can be found in a processâ€™s proc directory (/proc/[pid]).  Your program must be able to retrieve the following data about any given process:

    \ \\
    \textbf{Task\_Struct Members}
    
    \ \\
    Linux and UNIX distributions organize all internal process data into structures named task\_struct.  The kernel maintains one task\_struct member for each process running on the system.  Each task\_struct member contains two pointers specifically designated to point to other task\_struct members.  As such, the kernel organizes all task\_struct members into linked lists.  On startup, the kernel also initializes a pid hash table whose elements are linked lists.  This is done to save some time searching for process data structures.  Instead of having to search one large list (for perspective, pid\_max on the author's Debian 8 system is $2^{15}$), the kernel quickly hashes the process pid into one of the hash table elements and then searches a much smaller list to find the correct task\_struct member (Bovet, 81 \& Glass, 555).    
    
    \ \\
    A visual description of the organization of the task\_struct structure is provided in Figure 1.  Also provided, for the curious reader, is the entire listing of all task\_struct members.  Inside, you should be able to see all of the fields that you are required to find for the assignment (or at least pointers to other kernel data structures that actually contain those fields).  For even further reading see \textit{Bovet} and \textit{Glass} in the bibliography section

    \textbf{Process Relationships}
    
    \ \\
    Unix splits process creation into two commands.  The first, fork(), makes a perfect copy of the calling process.  This copy, known as the child of the process that called fork().  Not surprisingly, the process that called fork() is known as the parent.  Since having an exact copy of the calling process is not useful in most cases, the child process frequently utilizes the exec system call.  The exec system call completely guts an existing process (this includes all code, heap data, and stack data) and replaces it with a new program specified in its arguments.  Some examples of this process are shown below.  For more information about the functions used in the example, consult the man pages listed later in this report.  
    
    \begin{center}
        Example \#2: Uses of fork/exec
    \end{center}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
#include<unistd.h>          (*@// Contains fork and exec@*)
#include<sys/types.h>       (*@// Contains pid\_t datatype@*)
#include<sys/wait.h>        (*@// Contains wait \& waitpid@*)
#include<errno.h>           (*@// Contains errno@*)
#include<string.h>          (*@// Contains strerror@*)

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    pid_t pid = fork();
    
    if(pid == 0)
    {
        execl("/bin/ls", "/bin/ls", "-la", NULL);
    }
    else if(pid == -1)
    {
        cout << "[ERROR]: Fork failed: " << strerror(errno) << endl;
    }
    else
    {
        waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);
    }
    _exit(0);
}
\end{lstlisting}

    \ \\
    When a UNIX/LINUX system starts up, two processes are initialized by the kernel.  The first, process 0, is known as the swapper.  As its name implies, it controls the scheduling of all processes on the system.  The second, process 1, is known as init.  Init is critical in the initialization of the system and starts many important routines (This includes the login shell).  Afterwards, all other new processes are created using fork and exec.

{\large \underline{UNIX man Pages}:}

\begin{myindentpar}{5mm}

    One incredibly useful feature of UNIX operating systems that many new developers do not know about is the built in manual system.  Using the command 'man', you can access information about most aspects of the operating system from general commands all the way to system call APIs.  
    
    \ \\
    The structure of man pages in UNIX are organized into sections by number follows (Wikimedia Foundation):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \setlength\itemsep{-0.1em}
        
        \item General Commands
        \item System Calls
        \item Library Functions (Specifically, the C standard library)
        \item Special Files
        \item File Formats
        \item Games
        \item Miscellanea
        \item System Administration
        
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \ \\
    You may (or may not, that's fine too) find the following manual pages useful when creating this assignment.  Each one of these lines can be executed as a valid shell command to open a particular manual page.  Note, the number indicates the manual section that that function resides.
